# Social App

Social app application using NodeJs and ReactJS.
Used Formik to build the form to create new posts.
Used Yup to validate the user's input in the form to create new posts.
Used Axios to fetch tha data of the posts already created.
At first, used information of the jsonplaceholder API to populate the app homepage.
